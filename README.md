# How to deprecate a type in PHP

So you have this class or interface you want to rename to something else,
because you need to move that type to another package, or you have new coding
standard rules that need to be applied to its name. One solution is to use
inheritance and move all the code to the new type:

```php
<?php

// LegacyFoo.php

/**
 * @deprecated please use ShinyNewFoo instead!
 */
interface LegacyFoo extends ShinyNewFoo
{
}
```

This approach is great until your users write code that expects the old type,
and get the new type from your code instead:

```php
<?php

class Bar // registered and invoked by your library
{
    public function __invoke(LegacyFoo $foo) // crash
    {
    }
}
```

But fear not, there is another approach, that consists in creating an alias for
your type.

```php
<?php

// LegacyFoo.php

class_alias(ShinyNewFoo::class, LegacyFoo::class);
```

This creates an alias from interface `LegacyFoo`, to interface `ShinyNewFoo`.
You read that right, although it is `class_alias` and I used the `class`
constant, both work for interfaces. But this is not enough, because nothing
guarantees `LegacyFoo` will be autoloaded at some point. Using that type in a
parameter type hint does not trigger autoload, because surely the type should
be autoloaded when the object passed as parameter is instantiated. Well, this
optimization does not work for type aliases, which means we have to manually
trigger the autoload at the bottom of `ShinyNewFoo.php`.

```php
<?php

// ShinyNewFoo.php

class_exists(LegacyFoo::class);
```

Think this is over? Not so fast, there is more. Now that it all works, let us
put this in production, and see it burst into flames! `class_alias` calls are
so rarely used that Composer does not look for them when generating its
autoloader classmap. [Autoload
classmaps](https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/autoloader-optimization.md) are
a way to know which files to load without checking the filesystem first, which
is faster. To trick Composer into detecting the legacy type, we can declare it
as a piece of dead code:

```php
<?php

// LegacyFoo.php

class_alias(ShinyNewFoo::class, LegacyFoo::class);

if (false) {
    class LegacyFoo extends ShinyNewFoo
    {
    }
}
```

This will also fool most IDEs into providing auto-complete.

And finally, what if we want to trigger a deprecation error when the legacy
type is used? We cannot just do it since it will be autoloaded every time we
use the new type. All we can do is implement a best-effort solution:

```php
<?php

if (!class_exists(ShinyNewFoo::class, false)) {
    @trigger_error(
        'LegacyFoo is deprecated!',
        E_USER_DEPRECATED
    );
}
```

This checks first if `ShinyNewFoo` exists, *without triggering autoload*. If it
does not, then `LegacyFoo` is referenced somewhere and we can safely trigger a
deprecation.

Done. The following seems to have been fixed by now, or maybe does not occur
exactly in these conditions, you can ignore it. Leaving it here in case it
still appears in some conditions.

~~Nope, not done, you sweet summer child! It goes deeper.~~

~~This is an even rarer occurrence, but let us consider an interface that you
expose, and that uses the deprecated type in one of its signatures:~~

```php
<?php

interface Bar
{
    public function baz(ShinyNewFoo $foo);
}
```

~~What should happen to the implementation of your consumers?~~

~~Let us also consider that class that does something similar, but that you did
not mark as finalâ€¦ (or that could be `abstract`, same issue).~~

```php
<?php

abstract class Foobar
{
    abstract public function foobar(ShinyNewFoo $foo);
}
```

~~What should happen to extending classes of your consumers?~~

~~Well they shall crash and burn, of course! Since type hinting does not trigger
autoload, the alias does not exist, so PHP cannot know both type hints mean the
same thing.~~

```php
<?php

final class ExtendingFoobar extends Foobar implements Bar
{
    public function baz(LegacyFoo $foo) // ðŸ’¥
    {
    }

    public function foobar(LegacyFoo $foo) // ðŸ’¥
    {
    }
}
```

~~Unlessâ€¦ you guessed it, we need to add yet another call to `class_exists` (or
`interface_exists`) to trigger the autoload. In order not to get a deprecation,
we will use that on the new type, and it will in turn silently load the old
type and do the class alias.~~

```php
<?php

interface Bar
{
    public function baz(ShinyNewFoo $foo);
}
class_exists(\ShinyNewFoo::class);
```

~~To sum things up, every extensible interface, every interface that uses the old
type in one of its signatures should make sure to autoload the new type.~~

Done. Until next time. Wow that was hard, and I cannot say it feels very
satisfying. I wish there were a native way in php to do all this.
